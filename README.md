# skVerify

This is a discord bot made using Skript and Vixio.

This bot will link a players minecraft account with their discord account.

# Setting this up:

To set this up, you will need to head to your discord developer portal where you will need to create an application and then a bot. Invite the bot to your discord server, grab the bots token and look at the code. You will see there is two ' # CHANGE ME ' things next to two lines. Do what it says and change them to the correct thing. Start your server and BOOM it's done :)

# NOTE: Your bot will only be online when your server is up.
